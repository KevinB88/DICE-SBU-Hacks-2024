XP-Achievement system:

The pts can be broken up into: Full, Separate

Full: collectively across all classes

Separate: Each class receives their own score

When the student completes a task/assignment they are rewarded pts

Two conditions:

The student completes a task/assignment before a due-date:
-They are rewarded points * some multiplier
-Otherwise they earn the default number of pts

A "Streak" a student is able to maintain a streak:

For each subsequent day they complete: the score multiples
by some amount, and it reaches a max amount:

Perhaps the multiplier goes from 1 to 2.25
Each day the multiplier increases in increments of .25

Finalizing task:
Save the data to a data-base.

Possible data-bases:

PostgreSQL: Open-source object-relational data-base

Google Cloud SQL's free tier for students





Additional feature:
Generate a stat-table for the student





Priority-System:

Database options;

Storing the information that a user-enforces
to be a priority.

The priority of the course is defined by its color:

An index from: Darkest color (5) -> Lightest color (1)

This information will then be linked to the
schedule generation.
